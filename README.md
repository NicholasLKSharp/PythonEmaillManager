<h1>PythonGmail-EmaillManager</h1>
-----------------------------------<br>
This project is a practical use example of Google's Gmail API. Example programs are included in the root directory of the project, showing some capabilities of the api.

*PS this project is mainly for me to understand python programming and should not be considered fully optimized as my experience with python likely does not allow for such a scenario. Hopefully though some of the source code may come in useful for people who are beginning to develop Gmail api implementations or happen to have similar real-world dillemas that may be fixed with my examples.

Here is a quickstart for a bare bones project https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python and here is a tutorial which may come in useful https://blog.mailtrap.io/send-emails-with-gmail-api/
